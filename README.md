# DRL_Racers
DRL Enviroment for Lego Racers (1999)

Target: Human performance in a 3D racing environment using only computer vision. The unsupervised environment requires real-time learning and does not allow parallelization. Toolset: Supervised/Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning, CNNs, A2C, PPO, Pytorch.

Project Benchmarks:
    Training Cycles,
    Training Time,
    Total Reward trend,
    Reward Ratio,
    Race Time Trend,
    Completion Rate,

Because we will be generating Millions of cycles, the benchmarks will only be updates at the end of each race.
