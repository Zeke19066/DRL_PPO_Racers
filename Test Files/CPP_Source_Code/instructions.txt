convert c++ into a python usable library. 
Requirements:
	- CMake
	- Pybind11
	- Visual Studio 16 2019

In the 'source' folder:
	- If it's there, delete the build folder. This will be holding the last project.
	- modify/replace module.cpp in the module folder. This will turn into your shared library.
	- while in the source folder, run cmd from the address bar. Rund the following commands in order:
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
	-This will generate the new project folder for Visual Studio. In the build folder, run the .sln (solution) file
	to enter the VS code environemnt. There, navigate to your module source file and compile it. 
	- The completed .lib will be in the debug folder, and should run in python when imported.

to quick test, run cmd in adress bar, then run python, and try using the import library command.

you'll have to copy all the files from the debug folder into your working directory (Python) in order to import lib. (Maybe?)

Let's work on figuring out how to add a custom name for the lib.
