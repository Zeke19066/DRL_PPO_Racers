Minor:
    - probability update should be dynamic to ascending or descending protocols.





Performance Tiers
    - Knockout system where run will be terminated
    at lap if performance is below threshold.

Comprehensive Start-to-Finish
    - The training regimen should be able to account for
    all levels of agent proficiency.

Ideas:
    - The speed of learning is capped real-time to the underlying
    game implementation. Therefore the max cycles/second isn't limited
    to the ability of the NN script. Limit is set by intervals that allow
    the previous action to play out so that it has tangibly impacted the
    resulting reward.
